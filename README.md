This is a Django app that you can exam your students in. You can define tests, test groups, amount of questions from each topic to be randomed, define these topics. System can automatically grade based on rules you define.

You can view how students work in real time, and blah blah blah. You can even define sample "demonstration" tests and let unregistered users take them..

Contains an user manager. Students can register for classes, led by Teacher-class users, who define and coordinate exams. Exams can have multiple terms, and students that pass in one term won't be listed in adding them to next terms.

It's really hi-fi.

What a shame it's in Polish.


A project I made for 'Web Technology' classes.
